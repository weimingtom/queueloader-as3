#summary QueueLoaderLite intro

= Introduction =

QueueLoaderLite is an open source linear asset loading tool with progress monitoring. It's largely used to load a sequence of images or a set of external assets in one step. Based on QueueLoader, QueueLoaderLite functions in the same way but is simplified to load only images and swf files for a smaller file size. Ideal for using your own separate loaders for data and when advanced control is not needed.
