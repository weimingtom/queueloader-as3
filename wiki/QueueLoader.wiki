#summary QueueLoader intro

= Introduction =

QueueLoader is an open source linear asset loading tool with progress monitoring. It's largely used to load a sequence of images or a set of external assets in one step. Please contact me if you make updates or enhancements to this file. If you use QueueLoader, I'd love to hear about it. Special thanks to Felix Raab for the original AS2 version! Please contact me if you find any errors or bugs in the class or documentation or if you would like to contribute.
